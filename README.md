# A tic tac toe program

This program is a non optimize (and kinda trash) python program to play tic tac toe with a friend (or yourself).  

I would welcome any advices, changes and bug reports, but this project was only mean to train me to use github, wich I have never done before, so please dont judge me. This project will probably be deleted when i will understand how github work (especialy how to delete project)
