# A tic tac toe program

This program is a python program to play tic tac toe with a friend (or yourself).  

I would welcome any advices, changes and bug reports, but this project was only meant for me to train to use github, wich I have never done before, so please dont judge me.  
Iy features a classci game loop, and beacause it was made during an oriented exercice, you can find a lot of function that you can re-use on any other project.
